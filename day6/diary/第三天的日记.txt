Today was a difficult day. I had a fight with my best friend, and we haven't spoken since. It's been weighing heavily on my mind all day.

We had an argument over something small, but it quickly escalated into a bigger issue. We said some things that we didn't mean, and now we're both upset. I'm not sure how to fix things between us.

I've been feeling pretty down all day. I don't like being in conflict with my friend, and I don't know how to make things right. I've been trying to distract myself by reading and watching TV, but it's not helping much.

I think I need to give it some time and let things cool off. Maybe tomorrow we can talk and try to work things out. I just hope that we can get past this and be friends again.

Overall, it was a tough day. Dealing with conflict is never easy, especially when it's with someone you care about. I'm hopeful that we can work things out and move forward.
